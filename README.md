- **STOP_LIMIT orders:** Trigger at specified price, then execute as LIMIT
- **STOP_MARKET orders:** Trigger at specified price, then execute as MARKET
- **ICEBERG orders:** Large orders with hidden quantities
- Price collar validation prevents unrealistic STOP order executions

### 📈 **Real-Time Performance Monitoring**
- Microsecond-precision timing measurements

## 🎮 Trading Commands

### Basic Orders
```bash
# Buy 100 shares at $99.50 or better
> BUY LIMIT 99.50 100
✓ Order submitted: BUY LIMIT 100 @ $99.50

# Sell 50 shares at current market price
> SELL MARKET 0 50
✓ Order submitted: SELL MARKET 50 @ $0.00
[MATCH] You sold 50 units @ $98.75
```

### ICEBERG Orders (Large Order Stealth)
```bash
# Place large ICEBERG order showing only small portions
> BUY ICEBERG 100.0 2000 300
✓ ICEBERG Order submitted: BUY ICEBERG - Total: 2000 - Display: 300 @ $100.00
🧊 Your ICEBERG order is hiding 1700.00 shares behind the scenes...
[ICEBERG] Your ICEBERG BUY order placed. Showing 300 of 2000 shares @ $100.0

# When visible portion executes, more shares automatically appear
[MATCH] You bought 300 units @ $100.0
[ICEBERG REFILL] 300.0 more shares now visible @ $100.0 (remaining: 1700.0)
[ICEBERG REFILL] 300.0 more shares now visible @ $100.0 (remaining: 1400.0)
[ICEBERG COMPLETE] Your ICEBERG order fully executed!
```

### STOP Orders (Risk Management)
```bash
# STOP-LOSS: Sell if price drops to $95
> SELL STOP_LIMIT 95.0 94.5 100
✓ STOP Order submitted: SELL STOP_LIMIT - Trigger: $95.00 → Limit: $94.50 - Qty: 100.00
🎯 Your STOP order is now monitoring price movements...
[STOP] Your STOP-LIMIT SELL order placed. Will trigger when price <= $95

# BREAKOUT: Buy if price rises above $105
> BUY STOP_MARKET 105.0 0 50
✓ STOP Order submitted: BUY STOP_MARKET - Trigger: $105.00 - Qty: 50.00
[STOP TRIGGERED] Your STOP BUY triggered at $105.50 -> executing MARKET order
[MATCH] You bought 50 units @ $105.50
```

├── order_book.cpp        # Core matching engine (~100 lines, focused)
├── order_book_base.cpp   # Utility functions (price tracking)
├── stop_orders.cpp       # STOP order logic & triggering
├── iceberg_orders.cpp    # ICEBERG order management & refills
├── engine.cpp           # Trading engine coordination
├── thread_pool.cpp       # Multi-threading support
├── background_generator.cpp # Market simulation
└── main.cpp             # Application entry point
```

### Threading Model
- **Main Thread:** User interface and command processing
- **Engine Thread:** Order queue management and dispatching
- **Worker Threads:** Parallel order processing (auto-detects CPU cores)
- **Background Generator:** Realistic market activity simulation

### Order Flow
```
User Input → Engine Queue → Order Book → Matching Engine
                ↓
Background Generator → Direct Order Book Integration
                ↓
All Activity → Thread-Safe Logging → CSV Files
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Unified Order Book:** Single data structure for optimal cross-price matching
- **Memory Safety:** Fixed iterator invalidation issues in ICEBERG orders
- **Lock Contention:** Minimized through careful mutex design
- **Cache Efficiency:** Price-time priority queues for fast matching

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### ICEBERG Order Testing
```bash
# Test large ICEBERG order with multiple refills
> BUY ICEBERG 100 2000 300
[ICEBERG] Showing 300 of 2000 shares @ $100.0
[ICEBERG REFILL] 300.0 more shares now visible (remaining: 1700.0)
[ICEBERG REFILL] 300.0 more shares now visible (remaining: 1400.0)
[ICEBERG COMPLETE] Your ICEBERG order fully executed!
```

### Cross-Price Matching Validation
```bash
# Verify price improvement
> SELL LIMIT 95 1000     # Place sell at $95
> BUY ICEBERG 100 5000 500   # Buy at $100 - should match at $95
[MATCH] You bought 500 units @ $95.00  # ✅ Price improvement working
```

### Memory Safety Under Stress
- ✅ Zero memory leaks detected
- ✅ No iterator invalidation crashes
- ✅ Thread-safe operation verified
- ✅ High-volume stress testing passed
